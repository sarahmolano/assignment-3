<h1>Community gardens and food insecurity</h1>
<h2>By Sarah Molano. December 14, 2020.</h2>


  <p>Community gardens provide fresh produce and vital green spaces to New York City residents dating back to the 1970s. Now, amid the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent strain on food access to households, community gardens may be more important than ever. <br>
  <br>The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation supports over 550 community gardens throughout the city, but the concentration of gardens varies greatly. This may partially be due to population density, but some of these areas with a higher concentration of gardens also have higher rates of food insecurity.<br>

Brooklyn has the most community gardens with 255 throughout the borough, and it also experiences the highest meal gap rate, with <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/foodpolicy/downloads/pdf/2018-Food-Metrics-Report.pdf">80.9 million meals missing</a> in food-insecure households in 2018, according to the city's 2018 Food Metrics Report. <br>
  <br>The community gardens map shows a large number of gardens in many of the areas with the <a href="https://www.foodbanknyc.org/wp-content/uploads/Meal-Gap-Trends-Report-2016.pdf">highest meal gaps</a> — and areas highly populated by Black and Brown communities. Since these gardens are integral in granting healthy food access and eco-friendly spaces to these communities especially, some gardens are <a href="https://queenseagle.com/all/new-york-citys-community-gardeners-push-for-legal-protections">petitioning for legal protections</a> so they can continue to support their neighbors. <br>
<br>“For decades, community gardeners have benefitted New Yorkers by increasing access to fresh fruits and vegetables, strengthening social and cultural connections, and supporting healthy urban habitat for pollinators and other wildlife,” said Alexis Andiman, an attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law organization supporting the gardens’ petition.</p>
